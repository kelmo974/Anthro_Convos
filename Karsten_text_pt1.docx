 So I wanted to reach out to you after seeing your community of practice lecture. I've been engaging with all this for quite a while now. I did my masters on this topic as well. And so for some background, for my masters, I sent out a survey to medical examiner and coroner offices, basically medical legal practitioners, including forensic anthros, basically about their interaction with NAGPRA, how aware they were of the legislation, whether they'd encountered cases in their offices that turned out to be Native ancestors or just non-friendly significant Native remains, and whether they really had a procedure for those cases. And the responses I did get were not very encouraging. The forensic anthros had generally heard of the law, but a lot of them had not thought about it in a forensic context ever. And then the medical examers and coroners typically had not heard of it, which was not surprising. But by and large, their offices really had no formalized procedure for what to do with those cases. So a lot of it was just understood. So for some, they just continued to curate them. A lot of them were transferring them to museums to use for teaching collections and things like that. Some were rebaring them in potter's fields and not really documenting where they were being reburied. Some cremate them. A lot of offices in Florida indicated that they cremated them, things like that. So the responses were kind of all over the map. And obviously none of them were what we were hoping to hear. And none of them were really compliant with the law. So that kind of spurred a grant proposal that we put in with the tribes that I work with through NIJ for a tribal research capacity building grant. And we spent the last three years doing a lot of outreach, developing further relationships, and deciding how we wanted to move forward with the research. And that's brought us to where we are now, where the main objective is to be interviewing medical examiners and coroners, actually going to the offices with the tribal reps in the states that they're located in, kind of having them meet face to face and talking about the law, teaching them about the law, and then really trying to understand how many Native ancestors are kind of ending up in the medical legal system every year, including backlog of remains that offices have, and really trying to understand where they've been going or landing and really trying to capture baseline where we are in relation to all of that, and then what these offices need resource-wise moving forward to help them comply with the law. That's really where we're at. And that's why I wanted to talk to you about your experience working with MEs on cases, but also the lecture that you gave. I think a big piece of this is exactly how they're identifying individuals to be of Native ancestry, especially if they don't work with a forensic anthropologist or an anthropologist in general or an osteologist. So how exactly they're going about that process, because I've heard from a few of them, and they're just like, oh, well, we never get cases like that. And I'd be willing to bet that you have, you just don't actually know that you have. And that's part of the problem with you is how we shift how they handle certain cases so that they're not missing these individuals when they come through. So I thought your insight on that would be really valuable based off of your research and what you've been finding method-wise. Yeah, I literally was just working on revisions to an article for American Journal of Biological Anthro on human ed. So we submitted one and it got accepted with revisions and we're hopefully about to resubmit the revisions today. But yeah, so good timing, I guess. Yeah, awesome. So I have adapted my interview questions for the MEs for your circumstances. So the beginning part is just some demographic information that we're collecting from all the respondents just to see where everyone's at and then some questions about caseload and laws and things like that. So I know this already, but what is your official title? So I am my official title, I guess, is associate professor. And I'm also the chair of my department, unfortunately. Okay. And where did you receive your doctoral degree? The State University of New York in Albany. And what kinds of human remains did you work with during your graduate degree? During my graduate degree, I did primarily bioarchaeology. So it was mostly Neolithic European skeletal remains, but I also helped with NAGPRA compliance at the New York State Museum. So I did some work there in terms of inventorying and then did help on a few forensic cases there too. Well, so that actually ties in well. Obviously, you're familiar with the law, but I was wondering where you first learned about NAGPRA and kind of what your first engagement with the law looked like for you. Yeah, I first learned about it as an undergraduate student actually in Michigan. And I helped a little bit with inventorying there too and like cultural affiliation as an undergraduate student, but not a lot. But I was like kind of very broadly familiar with it at that point. So like, you know, early 2000s, like 06 or 07 or 08, something like that. And then I was familiar with the law as a graduate student, but not specifics. And I only really became familiar with the specifics after we discovered a large NAGPRA compliance project at UW Oshkosh, which I had to get way involved with more than I was as a grad student or undergraduate. And that's when I really became familiar with the law. So this was something we've talked a lot about even engaging with my research. And I had never thought about NAGPRA in a medical legal context. Like have you ever, had it ever crossed your mind working with it that it might relate to forensic cases or the interaction of those two realms really? Not until I became really familiar with the law, to be honest. When I would work forensic cases in Wisconsin, which is kind of unique because there's just not very many osteologists here. So that's like made me become more of a forensic anthropologist than a bioarch person. I would say that when I first would receive cases that were obviously archaeological Native American, I would say just call the State Historic Society and they can help with repatriation. And I just hands off at that point basically. And I don't do that anymore after I became more familiar with the law because in my experience, that kind of hands off moment is when those ancestral remains slip through the cracks. Right. Okay. So how many, so you are a consultant then for offices in Wisconsin? Yeah, I work a lot with Sadhana. Do you know Christina Soto? Yes. She's from New Mexico. Okay. So the only two people in the state that do any kind of osteo forensics is me and Christina. So Christina is in Dane County and she's the operate, like the operations director there. She's very busy, but she handles all the cases that come into Dane County. And then also like, so Dane is where Madison is. And so that they get referrals from some county MEs, like several across the state. So she handles those and then I handle everything else. And so I work a lot with the crime lab, our crime lab here. That's like the State Department of Justice. I work a lot with the Division of Criminal Investigation, which is like the actual police force of the State Department of Justice. That includes the state fire marshal. So I do a lot of those cases and I work with the FBI. So when the FBI does stuff in Wisconsin, that's usually with me. And then I handle medical examiners across, especially the northern part of the state, like north of Milwaukee, basically. If you're Milwaukee north, then I handle it. And then Christina kind of handles the southern part of the state. So yeah, I consult with a lot and like Brown County, which is where I live in Green Bay, handles the Door Peninsula and Ocana counties. And they have a bunch that refer there. And Fond du Lac County is a bunch that refer and then I handle all the forensic and throughout about those offices. So it's a lot. It's more than I ever thought I would do. It's what I primarily do now. And I mean, I should say, unfortunately, I do quite enjoy it, but it's I didn't predict my career to take this term. So I was going with that. So what is the medical legal structure in your state then? Is it like a regional or you don't have by county? So county, I mean, is no, I can't. We have corners. Yep. It's county by county specific. So some of our counties are corners. Some are medical examiners. And there's just a handful of pathologists that handle that, you know, any kind of autopsy caseload across the state. And do you receive cases from corners also? Or is it just all the time? And some corners work more or less with the state. So there are some counties that are like, we have a dead body. We are calling the state. And there are other counties that are like, we have a dead body. I can handle this. And it really depends on the person who's the, you know, who actually has the jurisdictional authority in the county. So the corners you work with, do they typically have any sort of medical training or is it more elected positions? They're elected. They're all elected. And in terms of medical experience, it's highly variable. So we have some corners that are nurse practitioners. So like they have some medical experience. We have other corners who have none. They're little politicians. Some are ex cops. To be honest, the medical examiners don't often have a lot of like medical or even scientific background. They're appointed. Some do a lot. Don't some are ex law enforcement, some are ex military. It's hard to predict county to county. Interesting. So how many, if you had to estimate how many cases you do a year now? You know, I count NAGPRA relevant cases. So just count, if I'm count like this last year contacted by law enforcement for human skeletal remains, I had 22 cases. And then how many of those ended up being NAGPRA related? Four. No, no, take that back. Because one had five sites and there's like many individuals, but they had a backlog of cases at Brown County and that was five sites worth of cases. And then I had three additional that I identified as Native American on top of that. So the number of individuals, I don't know off the top of my head, but it's eight separate locations. So what happens now that you're not taking the approach you initially did, what happens with those cases now once you've determined that they're NAGPRA related? When the DCI finds some of the remains or if a medical examiner, coroner, sheriff's office finds human remains and calls the DCI and then they call me, what I do is rather than let anyone take legal control over the remains, I take temporary custody and have a form about temporary custody. Take the temporary custody from DCI, perform my exam. And then with searching the WIPT, which is the Wisconsin Historic Preservation Database, if the location is close to known archeological sites and then the ancestry assessment, taphonomic assessment is consistent with the individual being Native American, sometimes there's associated artifacts, then I contact the contacts I now have with a group called WITRIC, Wisconsin Inter-Tribal Repatriations Committee. Then I'll contact them, let them know that I have temporary custody of ancestral remains. I will give them a report that I'll write up, same report I give to law enforcement, but I'll redact the images of human remains. Send that to them so they know why I'm saying what I'm saying. And then send it with pictures to law enforcement and then ask how they'd like to go about the process of transferring legal custody directly to them. And that allows us to avoid the long process in AGPRA. But that being said, I think it's been a process that's worked really well for the tribal groups. They appreciate it, they like the way that it works, and they're very busy, but actually I'm still in possession of all of those individuals. And most of those cases happened in June and July. But they legally, we've had forms signed online. So legally, we've already transferred the legal control to, in this case, the Ho-Chunk Nation. And then it's just a matter of transferring physical custody. And so that has worked really well, at least I think from the perspective of me, law enforcement and the tribal groups, where everybody's on the same page and it's kind of facilitated really rapid repatriation and reburial, or at least legal custody control, I should say. For the other cases where we have, where like they've had the possession of the ancestral remains for a long time and have taken and accession them and have legal control. I've volunteered to just do the skeletal inventory and make an ancestry assessment. So like we have some reason to believe that they're Native American. And then I've just volunteered to write up the inventories based on the forms we use for UWO's compliance project. For most counties, they're not willing to pay any money for this because their kind of budgets are tight. They don't feel like it's pressing, even if you tell them about the legal requirements. I shouldn't say that for every county though. Some counties are fine to be like, okay, let's do this the right way. And yeah, like we need to take care of this right away. But if you volunteer to do it, then everybody's really happy to let it go through. And then it's just straight nag per process, federal register, consultation, all of that. And so when you submit the inventory and the notice, are you submitting it as you at UW or are you submitting it as a consult for the office? All I'm doing is preparing it for them and then giving it to them and then they can submit it. So it's being submitted from the actual office with their name? The office has got the legal control. Yeah. I'm just basically their free osteological consultant. And so you said some are more receptive than others in terms of going through the legal requirements with them or explaining what the requirements are, the ones that maybe aren't as willing. Is it just a time thing? They just don't want to engage with it or? Just money. I mean, I think that's it. So like we work with Bernstein and Associates at UW Oshkosh. And so like, I mean, I'm an osteologist. I'm not a lawyer and I'm not like expert in the paperwork and such. So my original goal was to kind of team up with Jan Bernstein in an effort for her to handle that aspect and I can handle the osteo. But the cost was prohibitive for jurisdictions. I mean, it was just, they're not willing to pay it and they just can't. I mean, they don't have the budgetary, a county budget doesn't have, even with this, like in the city of Green Bay, they don't have the budgetary bandwidth to cover that kind of cost for NAGPRA compliance. Interesting. And like, could you see them ever applying for a NAGPRA grant or going about that route if you encourage them to take that route? Perhaps. I think that it's even when like, I mean, I think it's for all the counties I've talked to that have been like, okay, let's get this taken care of. It's a priority in terms of they want it done. It's not a priority in terms of current workload. So writing the grant, yeah, they would do it, but do they have the time to do it? If they have the time, they'll do it. And if they don't have the time, they're not gonna. Yeah. And that's, I mean, that's part of this has been a very broad spectrum of the level that offices are willing to engage not only with me about this topic, but just we, so here at our lab, because UT, we have the forensic anthropology center and that's where we do our casework kind of separate from our actual department. And we actually do casework for Kentucky and West Virginia. And we have received a number of cases here also that we've estimated to be native ancestors. And when I tried to engage with the Kentucky Emmys, they have a regional system, very short staff. And they, the girl just rolled her eyes at me. She was like, listen, I don't think you understand like the level of caseload that I have at the moment and that this is just a really low priority. And then so it almost doesn't matter if I explain the importance of the law, why it exists, that these are individuals that maybe don't need to be, are not going to be identified in the same sense as they are day to day, but there's still people that have a place to go. The reception to that is just, they don't, they can't listen to that. They just have, they have a daily op that they need to get through and that's where they're headed. And you're right. I think that's when stuff really starts to go through the cracks. I mean, I've worked with offices who've had remains sitting in shelves for 30 years. That is just like, well, on a rainy day we'll get to those. And then they just don't. And they don't have someone willing to do what you're doing for them. Yeah. I found, I found like, to be like real clear, I found no resistance to the repatriation process at all. It's just a matter of if it's like you've said, if it's left in the hands of the office, it's probably not happening. And just because of them being short staffed and all this, and luckily UW Oshkosh is like really supportive. So when we've talked to the vice chancellor that oversees this, I'll just tell him like, Hey, you know, you know, I do the forensic case. He's an old chief of police that helps the cause, but I'm like, you know, I do the forensic cases. I've got some that come in, they're NAGPRA. It helps build goodwill for the community by performing this act. Are you cool with on my NAGPRA time, me doing this work? And he's more than okay with it. And so, you know, it's, it's worked out well. Do you see, so you move on one day to another university or a different position? Do you see UW upholding that dynamic that you have with the offices? Or do you think that'll be largely dependent on who comes in after you or? I mean, I'm not planning to move. I'd move to Florida if I could, because it's cold as hell here, but it's, I'm not planning to move more than likely. So they hopefully won't have to deal with that. But I don't know the Wisconsin system, UW system is a little bit screwy. So like I'm the only osteologist in the system. I mean, there's John Hawkes who's paleoanthropologist, obviously, but he doesn't do like bio arc or forensics. And UW Milwaukee, which is like only our three schools have big, well, and lacrosse have big anthrop programs, but none of the programs except for Oshkosh has an osteologist. So like I've traveled to UW Milwaukee to help them with NAGPRA and I've gone there to give them trainings on ancestry determination. And actually, and this is kind of real crazy, actually just accepted 59 cold cases that were stored in an old professor who's now deceased slab that are all crime lab cases that he had kept there. He worked in the area before DNA and a large chunk of those are NAGPRA relevant. And they didn't know because they haven't had any osteologists look at them. They haven't really had an ancestry assessment done. So even for them, I'm going to do the same thing. I'm going to write up a report for the jurisdiction and then give the report to UW Madison so that they can use the ancestry information to use that in filing an inventory. And they'll do it like I'm not going to have to and Oshkosh is not going to have to file the inventory. All the cases on a short term loan. And so, but yeah, I mean, I think that's the trick, right? I mean, not to be like, oh yeah, osteologists have it all going or whatever. But I think like if you don't have somebody who can perform the work, then it doesn't get performed. Absolutely. And that's as we like my advisor and I, as we've been talking through this just in a perfect world, what would a solution look like or what would be the magic fix to this? And actually I submitted my master's thesis and results as an article to JFS. And it was actually the anthropology reviewer who once said she just didn't believe me. She was like, I think you made up your numbers. Like this law does not apply to medical legal offices. Like you're, you're just wrong and like really, really resistant. And my pushback and like the, the jurisprudence reviewer was like, actually it's a pretty simple definition and offices get federal funding and they take legal control of these remains like by state law. So it's, it's a pretty simple relationship and pretty simple designation. I just, I've received a, a lot of pushback, even from offices who are just like, no, we're and I think a lot of it comes back to just the vocabulary. As soon as they hear that term museum, it's like the light shut off. There's like, well, we're not like, well, no, not by our like cultural understanding of what a museum entails, but then you have to go through the whole special definition explanation and all of those things. And they just, again, it's kind of just like the shutters. They just, they just don't want, and anytime I email people and use like the museum word and stuff like that, I get usually very, very blunt answers. Like I don't think you understand what a museum is or a medical examiner's office. I'm like, no, I, and so legal definition, you know, I mean, that's the thing. Sorry. I'm just plugging my computer. So yeah, part of a, part of what we've been trying to get at is just how, yeah, like the, the particular vocabulary included in the law and those special definitions have maybe hindered how widely applicable it's been, even though clearly the definitions were written broadly on purpose to capture all the places that these remains have ended up. But I think these offices are, are an area that have kind of slipped by people really haven't engaged with on this level. And part of us trying to understand why, like how it slipped by. And I think part of it is that very few offices actually engage with an anthropologist. I mean, out of the thousands of Emmy and corner offices across the country, obviously there's not that many that either employ an anthropologist or consult with one for cases. And I think that's a big, I mean, look at Wisconsin, right? I mean, it was me and Christina and Christina works for an Emmy's office and I work at a university and that's, and we're it. And it's, I think actually, you know, to get a response that's good or like kind of positive one. I, I've had a good positive responses, but I went after I did the community practice talk. I am a member of like the Wisconsin medical examiner corners association. And so Christina actually was the organizer of their annual conference and she's like, Hey, you want to come talk about something? I said, Hey, I'll come talk about magbra. And so I went in there and not everybody goes to the conference, right? You don't have every County there. But I just talked about, okay, Hey, you're actually a museum. And I did this little presentation, but part of my presentation was, and if you have remains that you think are native American, number one, they might not be. So like I've had two counties come to me where they thought they had them. And I was like, no, this is a white lady. And then we sent it to DNA and we found that her living cousin in Belfast, Northern Island, and now we're working to try to ID her. So it's like, number one, you might not be right. And so you might actually have a cold case that they needs investigation on your hands. So let me just perform the ancestry assessment free. And then you'll know. And I said, and if it's not native American, then you can go down that road, see what you can figure out. And if it is native American, I'll help you repatriate them. Like you'll submit the paperwork, but I'll do the work. And I know that not everybody can do that. And I'm lucky my university supports me in doing that. But they come up like after I gave that presentation, I had a whole bunch of these jurisdictions come up to me and go, hey, Jordan, will you look at this? Will you look at this? And I was like, yeah. But and then I've worked with them for long enough to like, I know most of the people personally. So like, I don't think, you know, they probably they have, we have like kind of warm relationships. And so they figure, oh, yeah, why not take a look? And so that has that approach. I mean, I'm still trying like there are some counties I know I have that never even heard me say it and all of this, or maybe heard it and then like never called me or because in my experience, if you go to one of these places, they have at least some scalable remains that they don't know what they are. And so but that that approach has kind of worked, I think. But yeah, I mean, it's it's it's I don't know, it's probably not necessarily very sustainable approach either. But it's yeah. And that's part of that's part of what we're trying to figure out to you is what's a way to go about this, where it becomes something understood in offices across the country a lot like their other standard operating procedures, just like regardless of turnover, or who's in the position or who they consult with, they know that there is a special process for these particular cases. And how to go about instilling that is part of what we're working on. Also, something something we are working on is that through these interviews, and when we go to offices and talk to them about their caseloads, we're working on building a national database that each state like the particular medical legal structure is broken down. And then really, you can zero in on each office and get like contact information and then an idea of what they have currently in the office. And ideally, it's a way for tribes to start to go about claiming remains that may be in these offices or may be affiliated with them and like to know. I mean, the tribes I work with. So I work with the Seminole in Florida, the Eastern Band, the whole Magpra Alliance in Michigan, the Gila River in Arizona. And all of them, when we first talked to them about that was like, I've never even the same as ME offices having really considered Magpra, many of them have not considered ME offices as another place where their ancestors might have been ending up and under what circumstances. And so part of it has just been them interacting with this system for the first time also. And obviously, in itself is a very confusing system across the country. So we've I mean, it's been a learning curve on both sides about how to go about this. And some of it, I mean, it's what you your situation you have going there sounds great, where all three of you have come to an agreement and a system that works for everyone. And that's something we're trying to get at also is whether there's there's not going to be a cover all solution for across the country. There just can't be there's too much variability in that. So I mean, for a dissertation that doesn't lend itself really well is like, hey, here's my results. That's what everyone should do. But yeah, we that's why we're just taking it state by state at the moment. And what can we do in each of these situations that make the process better? But I think it's it is right now is a good situation in Wisconsin with the DCI and the crime lab. If they get the remains, they're going to call me. And if they call me, then we can facilitate the direct transfer quick. The bad news is the fact that there are some of those local jurisdictions that are going to come into these human skeletal remains. They are not calling the state. And like, I mean, I've worked for the majority of counties across Wisconsin that Christina doesn't cover, but I work for all of them. And so like, you know, what are those guys doing? I don't know. And, you know, some of those are rural counties where bones are getting turned up all the time. And then on top of the county level jurisdiction, there are plenty of local police forces or even sheriff's offices that when they come into contact with these human skeletal remains are not telling the emmy in corner and they're put they're making just an assumption off the top of their mind that this is Native American and they're putting them into evidence storage and they may be Native American, they may not be Native American, but they really don't know. And I think that that to me is actually scary in two directions. It's scary that these Native American ancestral man's are not repatriated or treated with respect. It's also scary to me that there are some forensically significant remains that get assumed to be Native American and then sit in evidence lockers for decades. And that happens a lot. I mean, I've had that happen to me in just the last two years. We've had it at UW Oshkosh in what was the archaeological collection. I'm like, this ain't archaeological. And I mean, it goes both ways. And if those remains are getting filed under inventories, if they if they ever reach that point or if they start engaging that way, I mean, that's obviously a whole nother problem. But so have you in your experience, like how have they been identifying or or what or how do they say they go about the process of identifying as Native American? I had one case in the last couple of months and it was a skull that was found during a homicide investigation in a house. The guy was a junk dealer and they got the skull. He was killed. And then they found the skull in the bedroom and the skull was taken into their possession. And where the house was, was near like some archaeological sites. And so the ME said, well, it's got to be an Indian head. And so he kept it. And then he saw my NAGPA presentation and he's like, well, I better send this to you. So he sent it down to me. And Fordisks says it's a white female and the posterior probability of Native American is less than one percent. And I mean, if I look at it, you know, not the way you should, but the trait list method, OK, it doesn't look like Native American to me. And the teeth have no dental wear. And in Wisconsin, that is not normal. And so that's yeah. So I mean, so he just made the assumption that this is a place with a lot of Indians. It's Native American. And and it's and a lot of times it's just off condition. I mean, if they look at bone, it looks like old bone to them. It's Native American. But that's it. There's no real anthropologically based ancestry assessment that's done unless it finds its way to me or Christina. Yeah, I was we've talked about this so many times. And yeah, an enemy who is not trained skeletally or a coroner. And what when they encounter these remains is they're like, all right, this is how I go about this process. And I'm sure the variability on that is all over the map. But so far, I've had that same interaction or that same experience where. If they can't indicate that it's something else, that's kind of the default almost. Yeah. It's a it's crazy. I mean, but we even had it where. I mean, like I said, it all kind of goes two ways. I guess I've maybe more conservative than a lot of folks. Like there was bones that turned up on the North Shore of Lake Winnabego. They were heavily soil stained. That's that's bones been buried forever. I was like, well, let's go look and see where these come from. And then we found that they came from polyester slack wearing person. And it was a forensic case, 40 year old homicide. So I mean, I think that there's no systematic way unless an anthropologist gets called in that these bones that are turning up if they're being looked at to be Native American or not, which is a big problem, I think. And I don't know how to fix that. I mean, I think it's a great marketing tool for anthropologists to be like, hey, you need you need us in these offices or you need to work with them because there's just cases are our expertise like kind of overlap, but they don't. Like I'm not doing an autopsy and I wouldn't claim I know how to do an autopsy, but you can't claim that you can look at a skeleton and say the things that we can say. Sure. It just seems like in death investigation and in the medical legal system, it's kind of this black box where people don't one, they don't understand the system, but they don't understand the variety of specialties that are required for all the different. I mean, like I get asked all the time if I'm a medical examiner, if I do autopsies, like no, no, nothing like that. I didn't go to medical school. I'm not a pathologist, but I mean, it just seems like a lot of it stems from people, maybe not wanting to interact with the medical legal system because they don't want to interact with death or know how it's handled. And it just seems like there's a lot of stuff that slips through the cracks in that, in that sense. There's definitely a lot. And I think the other thing I think is whenever I go to cases or I go to scenes to like do help with recovery or whatever, and they're like, come on Jordan, tell me it's Native American. I go, well, if it is, I'll tell you. But I said, but that doesn't mean that the legal requirements stop. And that's I think the big misunderstanding. Most of them think that is where the legal requirements stop. And I go, there's legal requirements. If we figure out this is forensically significant and there's legal requirements, if we figure out this is Native American, but if we've got human remains, we have legal requirements one way or the other. And they're going to require different work, but the legal requirements. And when they hear that, and I say it like kind of nicely and joking and all this, but it's like, you know, then it's kind of like, oh, okay, didn't really realize that. We figured if it was Native American, you're just taking it to your lab. And it's like, no, not taking it to my lab. I mean, I might have to to facilitate this repatriation, but you guys are legally responsible starting right now, no matter what. And that's, they just don't know. Right. And is that so in Wisconsin, is it state law that any inadvertent discovery, a medical examiner corner has to come to the scene? It is. Yeah. They don't always though. I'll tell you law enforcement does not always call them. Really? For sure. I think they can't, they're much more likely to call them if the office is run by a pathologist and they are a lot less likely to call them if the office is run by a corner. Because they just don't see a point in it. Yeah. And the relationship between the, whoever the medical legal official is and the law enforcement that plays a big role. And if those people are actually called out there, because sometimes they work great together and sometimes they do not. And law enforcement feels that they are like the arbiters of that. So like, do they feel like they need to be there or not? Then they're going to call them or they're not going to call them. And they're because they're the cops. Right. And is it law enforcement that decides to call you or not? Yeah. I mean, I work, I don't know, I work with all of them. So like the law enforcement will call me, the medical legal people will call me, the DCI will call me. That's another piece of this that's really interesting to me is that in most states, it's a police officer that responds to a scene. And then they're the ones who make the decision, all right, this looks old. I should call like a historic society or an archaeologist or this looks like. So really, in a way, sometimes they are the arbiters where they are law enforcement. There was no training in this regard is like, well, this looks old or it doesn't. And that's if I had to guess who I get called most by its law enforcement. I mean, I still get called and work with medical examiners and coroners. But if I was to go through my email and text messages, I 100 percent work more frequently with sheriff deputies and local cops and the FBI and the DCI than I do with any corner. I think this is about to time out. Do you mind if I send you another? Yeah, go ahead. I don't for sign on and get very much time because I don't want to pay for it. Oh, yeah, understandable. I'll go log back into it when you send it. Sounds good. OK.
